# 702 Advanced Political Science Research Project

The main objective of this project was to fully replicate a published study. The article that was replicated in this project was Potter and Tavits (2015) <sup>1</sup> . The code for this study is included in the author’s supplementary information which includes using base code of R. Another goal of this replication project was to utilize different packages (ggplot2 and tidyverse). It also includes different confounding variables to increase the model fit of all the new models created in the code and analysis. 

`Data` folder contains all the data used in the Rscript file. 

`Codebook` is a pdf list of variables that was originally used in the study. 

`potter_tavits_data` is the original data from the author’s study. 

`V-Dem-CY-Core-v12` is a dataset from Variety of Democracy, some of the variables within the dataset are used in the new models.
